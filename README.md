# TimetoShower
In this project, I will try to Ô¨Ånd what is the optimum time to take my morning shower. 
Context: Before the morning shower, I have to open the hot water and wait a few minutes so that the water reaches 35 degrees Celsius. My hot water comes from the city facilities, not from a building system. 
Objective: Reduce the costs by reducing the amount of water consumed before the shower
